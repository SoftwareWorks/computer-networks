# Connection-oriented transmission

Basic Idea: Linear Numbering Segments Using Sequence Numbers in the Protocol Header Sequence number allow in particular

- Confirmation of successfully transmitted segments
- Identification of missing segments
- Request again missing segments 
- Assemble the segments in the correct order

Problem: Sender and receiver must,

- Synchornize first (exchange of initial sequence numbers)
- Hold state (current sequence number, already confirmed segments, ...)

Compound phases:

1. Connection (handshake)
2. Data transmission
3. Disconnection (teardown)

Agreements: we initially assume

- the entire segments are always confirmed
- an acknowledgement indicates the next expected segment

Example: setting up and removing a connection

This type of connection setup is called a 3-way handshake

    |         SYN, SEQ = x        |
    |---------------------------->|
    |      SYN, SEQ=y, ACK=x+1    |
    |<----------------------------|
    |           ACK = y+1         |
    |---------------------------->|
    |                             |
            .......
    |                             |
    |        FIN, SEQ = x+N       |
    |---------------------------->|
    | FIN, ACK = x+N+1, SEQ = y+M |
    |<----------------------------|
    |          ACK = y+1          |
    |---------------------------->|
    |                             |

    |           ACK = x+2         |

## Sliding windows method

So far:

- In the previous example, the sender has always sent only one segment and then waited for a confirmation
- This method id inefficient, as a lot of bandwidth remains idle between the sender and the receiver depending on the Round Trip Time (RTT) ("Stop and Wait" method)

Idea: Tell the sender how many segments can be transmitted at once after the last confirmed segment, without the sender having to wait for confirmation.

Advantages:

- Time between submitting a segment and reciving a confirmation can be used more efficiently
- By negotiating these window sizes, the receiver can control the data rate --> Flow control
- By algorithmically adjusting the window size, the data rate can be adapted to the available data rate on the transmission path between sender and receiver --> congestion control

Problems:

- Transmitter and receiver must keep more condition (What has already been received? What is expected next?)
- The sequence number space is finite --> How are misunderstandings prevented?

Notations:

- Sender and reciever have the same sequence number space `S = {0, 1, 2, ..., N-1}`.
  Example: N = 16:
  ```
  Sender
  S: |xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
           W_s

  Reciver
  S: |  |  |  |  |  |xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |
                         W_r
  ```
- Sender window `W_s \in S, |W_s| = w_s`: `w_s` segments can be sent at once after the last cconfirmed segment.
- Receive window `W_r \in S, |W_r| = w_r`: Sequence numbers of the segments that will be accepted next
- "Move" the send and receive windows and overlap each other during the data exchange.

Agreement:
- Acknowledgement `ACK = m+1` confirms all segments with `SEQ <= m`. This is called a **Cumulative Acknowledgement**.
- Usually every successfully received segment triggers the sending of a confirmation, always confirming the next expected segment. This is called **Forward Acknowledgement**.

Note:

- In the following illustration most confirmations are only indicated for clarity (back arrows)
- The effects on the send and receive windows only affect the receipt of the acknowledged black confirmations
- This is equivalent to assuming that the indicated acknowledgements are lost

```

New problem: How to deal with segment losses?

Two possibilities:

1. **Go-back-N**
    - Always accept only the next expected sequence number
    - All other segments are discarded
2. **Selective repeat**
    - Accept all sequence numbers that fall in the current receive window
    - These must be buffered until missing segments have been retransmitted

Important:

- In both cases, the sequence number space must be selected so that repeated segments can be clearly distinguished from new segments.
- Otherwise it would be mix-up
    - Delivery of duplicates to higher layers, no correct order.

Question:

What is the maximum size of transmission window `W_s`, depending on the sequence number space `S`, so that the procedures work?

Go-Back-N: `N=16, w_s=4, w_r=4`

```

Notes on Go-Back-N:

- Since the receiver always accepts only the next expected segment, a receive window of size `w_r = 1` is principally suffices. Independently of this, for practical implementation, a sufficiently large receive buffer must be available.
- For a sequence number space of cardinality N, the following must apply to the send window `w_s <= N-1`, otherwise it can be mix-up.
- Discarding successfully transmitted segments but not arrivving in the expected order makes the method easy to implement but less efficient.

Selective Repeat: `N=16, w_s=4, w_r=4` (same case)

Notes on Selective Repeat:

- If one selects `w_r=1` and `w_s` independently of `w_r`, Selective Repeat degenerates to Go-Back-N
- For a sequence number space of cardinality N, the following must always apply to the send window: `w_s <= math.floor(N/2)`, otherwise mix-up may occur.

General remarks:

- In implementing these concepts, the receiver in particular requires a receiver buffer whose size is matched to the transmit and receive windows.
- For practical applications, the sizes of `W_s` and `W_r` are dynamically adjusted, which allows algorithms for congestion control and flow control on Layer 4.

## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the dominant transport protocol on the Internet (around 90% of Internet traffic, see [here](http://www.caida.org/research/traffic-analysis/tcpudpratio/)). It offers:

- Secure / Stream-oriented transmission via sliding window and selective repeat
- Flow and congestion control mechanisms

- **Source** and **destination port** are used analogously to UDP
- **Sequence** and **Acknowledge number** are used for secure transmission. It will not work with TCP entire segments but single bytes confirmed (stream oriented transmission).
- (Data) **Offset**
  - Specifies the length of TCP header in multiples of 4B.
  - The TCP header has variable length (options, see IPv4)
- **Reserved**
  - Not used in previous TCP version. MUST be set to 0 so that future TCP version can use the field if needed.
- **URG** Flag (Rarely used)
  - If the flag is set, the data in the current TCP segment starts with the first byte up to the point to which the **Urgent Pointer** field points
- **ACK** Flag ("acknowledgement")
  - If the flag is set, this is an acknowledgement of receipt.
  - Confirmations can also be "piggy backing" in TCP. At the same time, user data is transfered from A to B and a segment previously sent from B to A is confirmed.
  - The acknowledgement number always specifies the next expected byte for TCP.
- **PSH** Flag ("push")
  - If the flag is set, the send and receive buffer of the TCP stack are bypassed.
  - Useful for interactive application (e.g. Telnet connections)
- **RST** Flag ("reset")
  - Cancels a TCP connection without proper connection termination.
- **SYN** Flag ("synchronization")
  - If the flag is set, it is a segment that belongs to the connection (initial exchange of sequence numbers).
  - A set SYN flag increments the sequence and confirmation numbers by 1, although no user data is transported.
- **FIN** Flag ("finish")
  - If the flag is set, it is a segment that belongs to the connection termination.
  - A set FIG flag increments the sequence and confirmation numbers by 1, although no user data is transported.
- **Receive window**
  - Size of the current receive window `W_r` in bytes.
  - Allows the receiver to throttle the data rate of the transmitter.
- **Checksum**
  - Checksum over header and data.
  - Same as UDP, a pseudo-header is used for the calculation.
- **Urgen Pointer**
  - Specifies the end of the "Urgen Data" which starts immediately after the header and if set URG flag should be immediately forwarded to higher layers.
- **Options**
  - Additional options, e.g. **Window Scaling**, selective confirmations or specifying the **Maximum Segment Size** (MSS)

Notes on the MSS:

- The MSS specifies the maximum size of a TCP segment (user data without TCP header).
- For comparison, the MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) specifies the maximum size of the payload from the perspective of Layer 2 (everything including the IP header).
- In practice, the MSS should be chosen so that no IP fragmentation is required during transmission (Of course, this is not always possible in practice, since it is generally unknown on layer 4 which protocol is used on layer 3, whether options /extension header are used, or there is an additional encapsulation between Layer 3 and Layer 2 (eg PPPoe for DSL connections)).

Example:

- MSS on FastEthernet
    - MTU is 1500B
    - Therefore 20B is allocated to the IPv4 header and another 20B to the TCP header (if no options are used).
    - The meaningful MSS is therefore 1460B.
- DSL connections
    - An 8B PPPoE header is inserted between the Ethernet and IP headers
    - As a result, the MSS should be reduced to 1452B.
- VPN connections
    - Depending on the encryption method used, additional headers are required.
    - The useful MSS is not always obvious here.

## Flow and congestion control

**TCP Flow control:** The aim of the flow control is to avoid overload situations at the receiver. This is achieved by the receiver specifies a maximum size for the transmission window of the transmitter.

- Receiver uses the Receiver Window field in the TCP header to inform the sender of the current size of the receive window `W_r`.
- The sender interprets this value as the maximum number of bytes that can be transmitted without waiting for a confirmation.
- By lowering the value, the transmission rate of the transmitter can be throttled. e.g. when the receiving buffer of the receiver fills.

**TCP Congestion control:** The goal of congestion control is to avoid overload situations in the network. To do this, the sender must detect bottlenecks in the network and adjust the size of the send window accordingly.

For this purpose, a congestion control window `W_c` is introduced at the transmitter, whose size we call `w_c`:

- `W_c` is incresed as long as data is transferred without loss.
- `W_c` is reduced when losses occur.
- The actual transmission window always applies `w_s = min {w_c, w_r}`

There are basically two different types of congestion control in TCP:

1. Slow Start:
  - For each confirmed segment, `W_c` is increased by one MSS.
  - This leads to exponential growth of the congestion control window until a congestion threshold is reached.
  - Then continue with the congestion avoidance phase.
2. Congestion Avoidance:
  - For each confirmed segment, `W_c` is only increased by `(1/w_c)` MSS, which means after confirming a complete congestion control window by exactly one MSS.
  - A complete window can be confirmed after 1 RTT at the earliest.
  - This leads to linear growth of the congestion control window in the RTT.

TCP variants for congestion control:

- Here we consider a simplefied version to the essential implementation of TCP, which is based on TCP Reno.
- The individual TCP versions (Tahoe, Reno, New Reno, Cubic, ...) are different in details but are all compatible with one another.
- Linux currently uses TCP Cubic, which allows the congestion window to grow faster than other TCP variants.

The following description refers to a simplified implementation of TCP Reno:

1. 3 duplicate acknowledgements (duplicate ACKs)
  - Set the threshold for cognition avoidance to `w_c/2`
  - Reduce `W_c` to the size of this threshold
  - Start with the congrestion avoidance phase
2. Timeout
  - Set the threshold for congestion avoidance to `w_c/2`
  - Set `w_c = 1` MSS
  - Start with a new slow start

- The predecessor TCO-Tahoe, e.g., does not distinguish between these two cases and always performs case 2
- Basically, all TCP versions are compatible with each other, however, the different congestion control procedures can adversely affect each other.

Example: TCP Reno (with simplication)

Remarks:

TPC allows secure connections. The error control log mechanisms have been developed to address network overload.

- TCP always interprets loss of packets (data and acknowledges) and a consequence of an overload situation (and not as a result of bit errors of unreliable transmission).
- As a result, TCP reduces the data rate
- If, however, the packet losses are the result of bit errors, the data rate becomes unecessary throttled.
- Due to the constant halving of the data rate or new slow start, the send window can no longer grow to meaning ful sizes.
- In practices, TCP is overwhelmed even with 1% paket loss, which is not due to overload.

Layers 1-3 need to provide a "low enough" package error rate for TCP.

- In practice, this means that loss probabilities of the order of `10^(-3)` and lower are necessary or desirable.
- If required, additional Layer 2 verification procedures must be used to ensure this (e.g. IEEE 802.11)

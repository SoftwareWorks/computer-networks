# Multiplexing

Multiplexing on the transport layer includes:

- The coded data streams are divided into segments
- Provide each segment with a header
- The coded data streams are divided into segments
- Provide each segment with a header

Such a header contains at least each

- A source port 
- A destination port

Which, together with the IP addresses and the transport protocol used, uniquely identify the application on the particular host.

5-tuple consisting of:

```
(src_ip_addr, src_port, dst_ip_addr, dst_port, protocol)
```

- Port number are 16 bits in the known transport protocols
- Operating systems uses the 5-tuple (IP addresses, port numbers, protocol) to deploy applications to the applications.
- An application in turn addresses a socket using a file descriptor (integer value)
- Connection-oriented sockets can be used very easily after the connection has been set up, since the recipient is already established (read and write using system call `read()` and `write()`)
- Connectionless sockets require address information to be sent to or from whom (`sendto()` and `recvfrom()`)
